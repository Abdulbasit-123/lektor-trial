body:

This indicates the type of the attachment.  Currently only a small set of
attachments is detected.  The most useful attachment type is `image` which
identifies images.  The attachments are detected by the file extension.

!!!! This feature in many ways does not entirely work as you would expect
and should be taken is something that will improve in future versions.
